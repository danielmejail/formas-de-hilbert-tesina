#Quaternion Algebras

##Basics of Quaternion Algebras
###Definitions and examples
definition; reduced trace and reduced norm

###Classification
local classification; global classification.

##Orders and Ideals in Quaternion Algebras
###Some general remarks
multiplicability of the reduced norm; definition of the dual lattice; the
different and codifferent of an order; the presence of an involution.

###Some local remarks
orders in quaternion algebras over local nonarchimedian
fields; maximal orders are conjugate; invertible ideals and principal ideals;
Eichler orders and their ideals.

##Adele Groups
###Definitions and notational convention
restricted product; ring of adeles; the group of ideles of a quaternion
algebra.

###Measure
additive and multiplicative measures; measure on the restricted product;
measurable and integrable functions; convergence theorems and the product
formula.

##Orders and Ideals in Quaternion Algebras
###Some global remarks
local-global principle for lattices
Kaplanski's Main Theorem; invertibility and the conjugate
lattice (under involution); invertibility of the codifferent of Eichler orders;
(sated) Eichler-order ideals are invertible / locally principal.

###Results regarding reduced norms
the norm theorem of Eichler; strong approximation; correspondence between
ideals and ideles; ideal classes and ideal classes; another approximation
theorem involving reduced norms.
